In this module we'll get to work with *functions* and *random numbers*. With these Python components we can implement methods that can determine the integral of just about any equation! You don't need to have done any calculus to partake in this module, but some intuition with mathematical equations is quite relevant.

In the video below, meet Lydia Brenner and Jelle Aalbers from [Nikhef](http://www.nikhef.nl/) who tell you about their experiences with programming simulations for their research.
