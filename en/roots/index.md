# Roots

Write a program that calculates and shows the roots (the locations where
an equation intersects the x-axis) of the quadratic equation $$f(x)=x^2+2x-10$$.

    # python roots.py
    The roots are -4.32 and 2.32

## Specification

* Call your program `roots.py`.

* Create one function `roots(a, b, c)` that can calculate the roots of *any*
quadratic equation of the form $$f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$$. (**check the hints below!**) There are two possible
results the function could `return`:

    * an empty list `[]` when the equation has no roots
    * a list of two elements `[n1, n2]` in which `n1` and `n2` are the roots of the equation (these two elements could be the exact same in one case!)

* Your programs should then use this `roots()` function to calculate the roots
for $$f(x)=x^2+2x-10$$. Print out both roots

* Create a function `plot_roots(a, b, c)` that plot the equation and clearly
display the roots in the graph that you calculate using the `roots()` function.

## Hints

* You can draw a horizontal line with the function `plt.axhline(0, color='red', linestyle='--')`.

* Calculate the roots with use of the [quadratic formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula).

    * In what case does this formula indicate there are no (real-valued) roots?
    * Use [`math.sqrt()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.sqrt) to calculate the square root of a number. You'll have to `import math` to make this function work!

* To make sure you can show the computed answer neatly, call the function and store the result in a variable, as in the example below:

        result = roots(1, 2, -10)

* Later on, also test your program with a quadratic equation that has no roots (check if the list is empty). The program should print that the roots do not exist:

        This equation does not have roots.

## Testing

If you use `checkpy`, note that it does not check if your program has the correct output. It does check if the function `roots()` returns the correct result.

    checkpy roots

(If it doesn't work, try updating your checks using the command `checkpy -u`.)
